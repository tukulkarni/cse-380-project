Usage: gadd [OPTIONS] time name file

where "time" is the performancing timing in seconds, "name" is the
experiment identifier, and "file" is the path to a libGRVY style historical
performance database.

This utility is used to store application runtime measurements from various
compute resources to provide historical monitoring during application development,
perform system benchmarking, identify performance outliers, and facilitate
cross-platform comparisons.

OPTIONS:
  --help                  generate help message and exit
  --version               output version information and exit
  -q [ --quiet ]          suppress normal stdout messages
  -e [ --env ]            store runtime environment with timing
  -c [ --comment ]  arg   additional comment string for the measurement
  -m [ --machine ]  arg   machine name (default=local hostname)
  -j [ --jobid ]    arg   batch job identifier (default = -1)
  -p [ --numprocs ] arg   number of processors (default = 1)
  -r [ --revision ] arg   application/code revision (default = unknown)
  -f [ --flops ]    arg   measured FLOPs (default = 0.0)
